# Design Patterns

This project contains information about software design patterns. 
There will be code examples/templates for different object-oriented programming languages.
I will also try to add information about pros & cons, and the overall use of the design patterns in code comments or readme files. 

## Installation

Well you can just copy and paste the code parts in your projects. No installation is needed.
