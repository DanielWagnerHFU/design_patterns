# Design Patterns

This project contains information about software design patterns. 
There will be code examples and templates for different object-oriented programming languages.
I will also try to add information about pros and cons, and the overall use of the design patterns in code comments or readme files.
The focus is to find the perfect implementation for each programming language. 

## Installation

Well you can just copy and paste the code parts in your projects. No installation is needed. 

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
